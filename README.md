# Martello-Coding-Challenge
Presented at cuHacking 2020, Murder Mystery


- Sorts and organizes data based on user submitted metrics. Outputs data to an API created using Flask. 


factors such as the names of the indiviudals or the devices were hardcoded in due to the nature of the competition, however it would be easy to run a one time function (initialize) to generate a list of all available factors. 

i.e #for i in dataset:
     # if i['guest-id'] not in namelist:
      #  namelist.append(i)
        
        # and repeat for all factors
